# An Analysis of Bikesharing

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analsysis was to create a business proposal to bring a bikesharing program to Des Moines. To create the data visulatizations and analysis for this proposal I utilized Tableau to make it look proffessional and easily understood. The main parts of the analysis were centered around analyzing the bike trips, who rents the bikes, and what time of week and day they rent those bikes. 

## Results
To view the results and the analysis click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/joshua.merenstein#!/vizhome/CitiBikeStory_16148869711870/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes) and it will take you to the Teableau Public story I created for this proposal. There are seven different graphs and visualtions that you can click through. Above each visualtization is an explanation of what the results of each speciific graph means. 

## Summary
- The main results from this analyisis is that a large majority of bikesharing riders in New York City are males. We also learned that most people that rent bikes, especially males, rent them in the hours between 6-9AM and 5-7PM suggesting that people rent them to commute to and from work. With this knowledge we can compare that data to how many people we think in Des Moines would be as likely to rent during these peak periods as in New York City.
- Two additional visualtizations that I would suggest for further analyis would be to see the age of people who rent bikes and how long people typically stay as subsribers to the bikesharing companies. I think both of these visualtizations could give us much further inisght into if the bikesharing company would be viable in Des Moines.
